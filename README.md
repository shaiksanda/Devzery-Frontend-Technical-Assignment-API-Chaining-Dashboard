# API Chaining Dashboard

This project is a responsive web application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, demonstrating the ability to handle complex API interactions through chaining multiple API calls.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
git clone <repository-url>

cd <project-directory>

npm install

npm start


Approach
The application utilizes React functional components and hooks to manage state and lifecycle events.
It integrates with the JSONPlaceholder API to perform GET and POST requests, demonstrating API chaining.
Tailwind CSS is used for styling, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.

Assumptions and Decisions
Assumptions:

Users have basic knowledge of React and API interactions.
The JSONPlaceholder API is used as a mock API for demonstration purposes.
Decisions:

Each major feature is encapsulated in its own component for modularity and reusability.
State management is centralized in the main App component to pass necessary data and functions to child components.
Completed Features
User selection from a list fetched via a GET request.
Creation of a new post linked to the selected user via a POST request.
Display of the created post details.
Automatic fetching and display of comments related to the created post.
Known Issues
There may be occasional delays in loading due to network conditions.
The design can be improved further for better aesthetics.
